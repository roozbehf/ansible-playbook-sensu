# Sensu Installation using Vagrant with Ansible

This is an evolving example to install sensu on Ubuntu using Vagrant with Ansible.

Please report or correct any errors you may find. :-)

## Instructions
1. Make sure that you have installed [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home).

2. Run ```vagrant up```. When it is done, the machine should be up and running with a sensu server installed.

3. When you are done playing around, you can turn off the machine (```vagrant halt```) or destroy it by ```vagrant destory```.
